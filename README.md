## Features

- Generate multiple seed phrases of customizable length (default: 12 words)
- Process word lists from various input sources:
  - Interactive command-line input
  - Text files
  - Standard input (stdin)
- Automatically removes duplicate words from input
- Provides statistics about the combination space of your word list
- Simple command-line interface with multiple options

## Installation

No external dependencies are required! Simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROHITCRAFTSYT/Seed-phrase-generator
cd Seed-phrase-generator
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python seed_phrase_generator.py
```

This will prompt you to enter your word list and then generate 10 seed phrases of 12 words each.

### Command-line Options

```
usage: seed_phrase_generator.py [-h] [-l LENGTH] [-n NUMBER] [-i] [-f FILE]

Generate blockchain seed phrases from a list of words

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning**: This tool is for educational and experimental purposes only.

For actual cryptocurrency wallets, please use:
- Hardware wallets (like Ledger, Trezor)
- Well-established wallet software with BIP39 standard implementation
- The standard BIP39 wordlist which ensures compatibility across wallets

Never share your actual seed phrase with anyone or store it digitally.

## Limitations

- Does not implement BIP39 checksum validation
- Cannot generate all possible combinations (impossible due to combinatorial explosion)
- Not intended for production use with real cryptocurrency assets
